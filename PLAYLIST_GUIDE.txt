SONG PLAYLIST STRUCTURE GUIDE
================================================================================

The app uses a folder-based playlist system. You need to organize your music
files into folders based on emotions.

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
-----------------
AI-201/
└── music/
    ├── Happy/          ← Put happy/cheerful songs here
    ├── Sad/            ← Put sad/melancholic songs here
    ├── Energetic/      ← Put high-energy/fast-paced songs here
    └── Calm/           ← Put relaxing/peaceful songs here


SUPPORTED AUDIO FORMATS:
------------------------
✓ .mp3  (Most common)
✓ .wav  (High quality)
✓ .ogg  (Compressed)


HOW TO ADD SONGS:
-----------------
1. Navigate to: C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\github\AI-201\music\

2. Open the emotion folder you want (e.g., "Happy")

3. Copy your music files into that folder

4. Example:
   music/
   └── Happy/
       ├── song1.mp3
       ├── song2.mp3
       └── song3.wav

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
1. The app will automatically detect songs when you restart it
2. You can add as many songs as you want to each folder
3. The app randomly selects a song from the appropriate folder
4. Songs loop until your emotion changes
5. If a folder is empty, no music will play for that emotion


QUICK SETUP:
------------
1. Create folders (if they don't exist):
   - music\Happy
   - music\Sad
   - music\Energetic
   - music\Calm

2. Add at least 1-2 songs to the "Happy" folder (most important for mood-changing!)

3. Restart the app

4. The app will automatically load all songs from the folders
